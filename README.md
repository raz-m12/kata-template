# Differences to the args-kata branch
This is technically the same problem as the one described in the 
args kata branch. For the full problem description [click here](https://github.com/raz-m12/kata-template/tree/args-kata).
The differences lie in the fact that here I try to make extensive use of
GMock's [mocking API](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html).
